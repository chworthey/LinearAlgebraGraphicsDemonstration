# Linear Algebra Graphics Demonstration

## What is it?
It's a tool that allows one to play around with transform matrices commonly used in 3D graphics! 
Add your own translations, rotations, scales, and more onto a transform stack, which ultimately results
in the output to the screen! Gain an intuitive understanding of the way transforms work.

## Installation
* Install Visual Studio 2017
* Build (this also restores NuGet packages)
* Done

## Usage
### Keyboard Controls
* W - Pitch up
* S - Pitch down
* A - Yaw left
* D - Yaw right
* E - Raise
* Q - Lower
* SPACE - Sniper scope
* Left - Move Left
* Right - Move Right
* Up - Move Forward
* Down - Move Backward

### Gamepad Controls
* Left thumbstick - Move
* Right thumbstick - Look
* Right Bumper - Raise
* Left Bumper - Lower
* *Click* right thumbstick - Sniper scope

### Console Window Usage
The command 'Help()' will tell you most of what you need to know! Expression parsing (and constant PI) is in-console,
so commands like RotX(-PI/2 + 3*PI) are valid!

Have fun!
